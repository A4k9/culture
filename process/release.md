# Product Release
- The goal is to make a release every month or earlier with features that are required by the users.  For MayaOnline we believe in releasing at least daily.
- We are going to be driven mainly by the data on the quality metrics not by management push (such as, let us release today otherwise we are going to suffer a deviation from the planned milestone) 
- Release Managers (Gates and gate managers)  are clearly defined and system suffers a dearly when quality is not matching as measured by an automated test system.
- There are going to be situations where it makes business sense to gain more market visibility that drives the releases, in such cases, the features delivered are tagged appropriately - as alpha, beta and stable based on the metrics.
