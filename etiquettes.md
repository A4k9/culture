# Household manners

This section covers some suggestions that are considered good household manners. 

## Online meetings (voice or video)

- On time, there is always a ramp up time due to unforeseen reboots which we all have which is fine
- Be prepared, find a calm place, with as little background noise as possible
- Don’t eat during the call the crispy sounds can be heard better than you think!
- Mute yourself, there’s a mute button for a reason. It might not seem like it, but there’s a lot of background noise even in the quietest of offices. There may also be feedback you can’t hear, but everyone else can. Unless you’re speaking, keep your phone on mute. However, don’t use this feature as an excuse to sneak a snack. Refer back to the last point for a reminder.
- Make sure to say goodbye, and do so with a smile
- When group calling, don't use a cell phone on speaker, they are not sufficient
- If you must use for whatever reason (did you prepare?) make sure that it does not vibrate
