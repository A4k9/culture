# PLOW

This document gives some examples that define our four values: **P**eople First, **L**isten to Learn, **O**penness and **W**inning **(PLOW)**. Our values are interlinked and work together to protect our culture. 

## People First
Helping others is a priority, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that you are trying to achieve. Similarly, you can rely on others for help and advice - in fact; you're expected to do so. Anyone can chime in on any subject, just like in good families. The person who has to do the work decides how to do it, but you should always take the suggestions seriously and try to respond and explain.

- **Say thanks** Recognize the people that helped you publicly, for example in our #thanks chat channel or on 15Five.
- **Make someone’s day today** It is a long journey. Over time happy team members are healthier, productive and bring positiveness to the others. Remember, we all want to be in a group where we are happy. Be thoughtful and kind just because you can. Catch people doing things right. Help a team member who's having a difficult time or need mentors. Be a good listener. Share your joy. 
- **Kindness** We value caring for others. Give as much positive feedback as you can and do it in a public way.
- **Negative is 1-1** Give negative feedback in the smallest setting possible, one-on-one video calls are preferred. Remember, we are all on the same boot. And the purpose of negative feddbacks is not to hurt a person, it is go get MayaData better and better and win together.
- **Don't pull rank** If you have to remind someone of the position you have in the company you're doing something wrong, people already know we have a hierarchical decision making process. Explain why you're making the decision and respect everyone irrespective of their function.
- **Get to know each other** We use a lot of Slack communication and if you know the person behind the text it will be easier to prevent conflicts. To encourage people to get to know each other on a personal level through our team calls, virtual coffee breaks, events and during company gatherings.
- **Do it yourself** Our people first value is about helping each-other when we have questions, need critique or need help. No need to brainstorm, wait for consensus, or do with two what you can do yourself. If you think it is better than what is there now do it, no need to wait for something polished. A task done today is better than a polished result delayed indefinitely.

## Listen to learn
- Listen to users in the openebs-users and sig-storage channels, ask clarifying questions. Learn and document the usecases that users are trying to solve.
- Listen to peers and their fears about the solution. The fears may be founded on the research and experience they bring. Validate them by talking to users. 


## Openness 
Be open about as many things as possible. By making information public we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. Openness creates awareness for MayaData, allows us to reach out to people that care about our culture, it gets us more and faster feedback from people outside the company, and makes it easier to collaborate with them. It is also about sharing great software, documentation, examples, lessons, and processes with the world in the spirit of open source, which we believe creates more value than it captures.

- **Public by default** Everything at MayaData is public by default unless it’s documented otherwise here.
Directness is about being transparent with each other. We try to be both straightforward and kind, no-bullshit and no-asshole. Feedback is always about your work and not your person. 
- **Anyone and anything can be questioned** Any past decisions and guidelines are open to questioning as long as you act in accordance with them until they are changed.
- **Disagree and commit** Everything can be questioned but as long as a decision is in place we expect people to commit to executing it, which is a common principle.
- **Transparency is only a value if you do it when it hurts.** For example, many companies in California do not give you the real reason why they declined your application because it increases the chance of legal action. We want to only reject people for the right reasons and we want to give them the opportunity to grow by getting this feedback. Therefore, we'll accept the increased risk of holding ourselves to a high standard of making decisions and do the right thing by telling them what we thought.
